# Demo of Microsoft Orleans
Orleans is a cross-platform framework for building robust, scalable distributed applications. Distributed applications are defined as apps that span more than a single process, often beyond hardware boundaries using peer-to-peer communication.

## The Action Model
> Orleans is based on the "actor model". The actor model originated in the early 1970s and is now a core component of Orleans. The actor model is a programming model in which each actor is a lightweight, concurrent, immutable object that encapsulates a piece of state and corresponding behavior. Actors communicate exclusively with each other using asynchronous messages. Orleans notably invented the Virtual Actor abstraction, wherein actors exist perpetually.
